### In summary 

Indonesia plans to accelerate the energy transition at the G20 conference. In the energy transition, the priority issue raised was to increase clean energy and over time to realize the plan, the coal power plant was shut down. The application of PV is one of the clean energy plants because it is low in emissions. The DIY government in its Regional Energy General Plan document supports and targets the use of rooftop solar power in its household sector. Therefore, we estimate the potential substitution of electricitysupply and emissions with PV rooftop in DIY through a system dynamics approach. The system dynamics approach is modeled through a causal loop diagram, after which, the model will be developed into a stock and flow diagram using Vensim software. The diagram will consist of mathematical equations that describe each variable involved in the system. The scenario development process is used to identify parameter scenarios and structure scenarios in the model. Substitution of electricity demand and plant emissions in the PV technology adoption scenario (Bass Diffusion) in 2025 substituted 0.046 - 0.12% for electrical energy and 0.044 - 0.11% reduced emissions, in 2035 increased to 0.42 - 1.13% substituted electricity and 0.4 -1.08% reduced emissions. For the RUED target scenario in 2025 substituted electrical energy amounted to 5.1 - 12.8% and 4.9 -12.3% reduced emissions, in 2035 decreased to substituted electrical energy 3.3 - 8.3% and 3.19 - 7.9% reduced emissions.
